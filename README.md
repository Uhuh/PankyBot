## Description

I'm not going anywhere big with this project. I've just made a few DiscordJS bots previously and just had a good time doing them.

## Getting Started

To setup and run Panky

`git clone git@github.com:Uhuh/PankyBot.git` <br >
`cd PankyBot/` <br >
`npm install` <br >

Now before you start your bot you need to set up the environment variables. <br >
Using your preferred text editor or IDE (I will use nano in this case) <br >
`.env` should be in the root folder of the project: `PankyBot/.env` <br >
`nano .env` <br >
Now within `.env` <br >
```
PREFIX=!
TOKEN=superSecretToken
GUILD_NAME=`Your server name`
```
Save this file, now you're ready to start!

`npm run start` <br >
